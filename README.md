Peppermint allows developers to easily create functional Vue tests without having to write any code. It dynamically converts user inputs into executable test code by using DOM query selectors provided by the vue-testing-library.

Peppermint is currently under development! We are looking for beta testers. Please open a new issue with details to report a bug.
